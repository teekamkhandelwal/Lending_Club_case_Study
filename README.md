# Objective\Purpose
Purpose of this case study to provide help in taking decision of consumer financial company to approved loan or not based on persons historical data(Profile Data).

# Project Discription
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
 
 * If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 * If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. 

In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
